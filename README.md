==========

This code comprises the most relevant parts of the PASER implementation in OMNeT++ 4.2.x - Linux. The same code but with different configuration (linking OpenSSL) is provided for Windows in the master_windows branch. 

The code depends on the INETMANET framework. A modified version of the official framework, with respect to statistics, using which this code is tested, is provided in the INETMANET branch. 

The code assumes that the OpenSSL development files are installed on the system, e.g., the libssl-dev packet should be installed when using ubuntu.
